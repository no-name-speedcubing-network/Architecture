# Basic concept

### Social network for speedcubers

####

This application must have a web interface.
The user can register on the website by email.  After basic registration, 
the user will receive a confirmation of the continuation of registration. 
The email must have a unique link. The user who goes by a link should be
redirected to the profile page and add his full name, bio, and avatar. 
Next, the user can use DjangoGramm. 
He can create posts with images, looks posts of other users via a feed 
of the latest posts. Unauthorized guests cannot view the profile and pictures of users.

Each post may have multiple images <br>
Each post may have multiple tags.<br>
New tags may be added by authors.<br>
Users may like posts (and unlike as well)

##### My edits <br>
Also in profile user can add his average time of solving different Rubik's cubes 
(pb (personal best), avg 5 (average of 5 solves), avg 100, avg 1000), user can fill
in field with types and models of cubes that he uses.<br>
Program must have timer for speed-cubing and user must have ability to share his results
for one solve/day/week, and after this post about results people can click on it and see
all solves for that time with scrambles.
